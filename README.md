## Project Theme:

Radha Store, an E-commerce platform offering a wide array of products across various categories, seeks to analyze its sales performance for 2022. The objective is to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior and patterns. As a data analyst, I will leverage the provided sales data to develop an Annual Sales Report for 2022, addressing the specified business requirements and challenges by implementing them as analytical goals in the dashboard report.


## Tools Implemented:

* Microsoft Excel.
* Powerr Query Editor.

## Development Approach:

In our project development approach, we focus on understanding the source data and the analytical objectives, which are treated as our guiding principles throughout the process. We then meticulously clean the data to rectify any inconsistencies, and proceed to process it, creating new columns or aggregating data where necessary to enhance its utility. The data is then thoroughly analyzed, employing a variety of visualization techniques and charts to bring insights to life. Finally, these insights are consolidated into an intuitive dashboard, ensuring a comprehensive and actionable understanding of the sales performance for Radha Store in 2022.

The Project Development comprises following key steps-
1. Understanding the Source Data and Analytical Goals.
2. Data Cleaning.
3. Data Processing.
4. Data Analysis.
5. Data Visualizations and Dashboarding.
